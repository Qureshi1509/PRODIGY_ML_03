Unfortunately, due to the size of the dataset being excessively large I couldn't attach along . 
You can download it from the below link:

REMEMBER ! : To avoid computational delays I have deducted the size of data from 5000 images of each cat and dog to 250 images of each.
the unseen image used is attached along which happened to correctly classified thus proving the betterment of my model under the classification criteria..
